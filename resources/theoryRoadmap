# 🧠 LAYER 1 — Core Cybersecurity Concepts (Foundation)

Before tools, you must understand what you're detecting.

## 1️⃣ Basic Cybersecurity Fundamentals

Learn:

* What is an attack?
* CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
* Threat vs Vulnerability vs Risk
* Attack surface
* Defense in depth

Study:

* Basic cybersecurity intro course (YouTube / free MOOCs)
* OWASP Top 10 (basic idea)

---

## 2️⃣ Linux System Internals (Very Important)

Because your project is Linux-specific.

Learn:

* How Linux users work
* Permissions (chmod, chown)
* /etc/passwd
* /etc/shadow
* sudo
* Cron jobs
* SSH
* Process lifecycle
* What happens when you run a command
* Syscalls (basic idea)

Without this, you cannot understand logs.

---

## 3️⃣ Linux Logging System

Learn:

* What is syslog
* What is auth.log
* What is auditd
* What kind of events appear in logs
* How logs are structured
* How to read logs manually

Practice:

* Trigger events
* Read logs
* Understand what each line means

---

# 🔎 LAYER 2 — Security Monitoring Concepts

Now you move into detection thinking.

---

## 4️⃣ What is SIEM?

Understand:

* Log aggregation
* Normalization
* Correlation
* Alerting
* False positives

You don’t need ELK knowledge deeply.
You need the **concept**.

---

## 5️⃣ What is EDR?

Understand:

* Endpoint monitoring
* Process execution logging
* Behavioral detection
* Lateral movement
* Persistence

---

## 6️⃣ Incident Response Basics

Learn:

* NIST Incident Response lifecycle:

  1. Preparation
  2. Detection
  3. Containment
  4. Eradication
  5. Recovery
  6. Lessons learned

Your playbook must align with this.

---

# 📊 LAYER 3 — Detection & Analytics Thinking

Now we move into intelligence.

---

## 7️⃣ What is UEBA?

Learn:

* Behavioral baselines
* Anomaly detection
* What is “normal” vs “abnormal”
* Time-window based analysis

Understand:

If user logs in 1 time/day normally,
and suddenly logs in 20 times → anomaly.

---

## 8️⃣ Correlation Logic

Learn:

* Time-window grouping
* Entity linking (user, IP, host)
* Attack chains
* MITRE ATT&CK framework (high-level)

You must understand:

A single log is weak.
Multiple related logs = incident.

---

# 🤖 LAYER 4 — AI & LLM Foundations

Now the AI part.

---

## 9️⃣ Basic Machine Learning Concepts

You do NOT need deep math.

Understand:

* Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
* What is anomaly detection
* What is Isolation Forest
* What is clustering
* What is feature extraction

Just conceptual clarity.

---

## 🔟 Local LLM Fundamentals

Understand:

* What is a transformer?
* What is prompt engineering?
* What is structured output?
* Why hallucinations happen?
* Why validation layer is needed?

You don't need to train models.
You need to use them safely.

---

# 🧰 LAYER 5 — Tech Stack Tools

Now tools make sense.

---

## 11️⃣ Python (Strongly)

You must know:

* File handling
* JSON
* Classes
* Async basics
* REST APIs (FastAPI)
* SQLite basics

If Python is weak, everything becomes hard.

---

## 12️⃣ Redis / Caching Concept

Learn:

* What is caching?
* Key-value store
* Why deterministic lookup is faster than recomputation?

---

## 13️⃣ Basic Networking

Understand:

* IP addresses
* Ports
* SSH
* TCP vs UDP
* Firewalls

Because your logs will contain network events.

---

# 📈 LAYER 6 — System Design Thinking

Now big picture.

Learn:

* Pipeline architecture
* Modular design
* Stateless vs stateful
* Event-driven systems
* Scalability thinking

---

# 🧪 LAYER 7 — Attack Simulation

Finally:

Learn basic attack techniques:

* SSH brute force
* Privilege escalation basics
* Reverse shells (conceptual)
* Persistence techniques (cron, services)

You’re not becoming a hacker.
You’re learning what to detect.

---

# 🎓 Order You Should Study

Follow this exact sequence:

1. Linux basics
2. Linux logging
3. Cybersecurity fundamentals
4. SIEM & EDR concepts
5. Incident response lifecycle
6. Python strengthening
7. Anomaly detection basics
8. Correlation logic
9. Local LLM basics
10. System design

Do NOT start with LLM or PyOD.
That’s advanced layer.

---

# ⏳ Realistic Time Expectation

If you study seriously:

* 2–3 weeks for fundamentals
* 2 weeks for implementation learning
* 3–4 weeks for building

Rushing will cause confusion.

---

# 🎯 Honest Advice

Right now your biggest risk is:

Trying to build advanced AI detection without understanding:

* What attack logs look like
* Why something is malicious
* What a correct containment action is

If fundamentals are weak,
your system will generate nonsense confidently.
